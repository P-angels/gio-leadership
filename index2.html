            <h2 class="titleText">What is the difference between classical and contemporary leadership styles in organisations?</h2>
            <p class="title-text">Classical leadership is characterized by a hierarchical structure where authority is centralized, decisions are made by leaders with little input from subordinates, and communication tends to be top-down. This approach often focuses on maintaining order, efficiency, and task completion, with employees primarily seen as tools for achieving organizational goals. In contrast, contemporary leadership embraces a more decentralized, collaborative approach, where leaders empower employees, encourage feedback, and foster open communication. Contemporary leadership prioritizes flexibility, innovation, and the development of employees, recognizing that a motivated and engaged workforce is key to organizational success. These styles are more suited to todayâ€™s dynamic, fast-changing work environments.</p>

        <img src="images/images (1).jpeg" alt="Classical Leadership">
        <h3>Classical Leadership</h3>
        <p>Classical leadership is traditionally characterized by a highly structured, hierarchical system where decision-making is concentrated at the top, with little to no involvement from lower-level employees. The focus is primarily on strict task management, efficiency, and achieving predefined goals through the implementation of rigid rules and procedures, where leaders dictate actions and employees are expected to follow orders without significant input.</p>

      <div class="image-box">
        <img src="images/leaderrr.jpeg" alt="Contemporary Leadership">
        <h3>Contemporary Leadership</h3>
        <p>In contrast, contemporary leadership emphasizes a more dynamic and flexible approach, where leaders encourage collaboration, communication, and the active participation of employees at all levels. This style is centered around empowering individuals, promoting innovation, and fostering a culture of creativity and adaptability. Leaders in this model work to motivate and inspire their teams to share their ideas and take ownership of projects, while also being responsive to the ever-changing demands of the business environment.</p>
